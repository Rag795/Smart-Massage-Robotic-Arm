                <h1>Our Inspiration</h1>
                <div class="inspiration-content">
                    <div class="inspiration-text">
                        <p>The inspiration for our Relaxtron project emerged from recognizing the growing need for accessible and consistent therapeutic solutions in physiotherapy and wellness care. Hand massages offer significant benefits—improving blood circulation, reducing stress, and alleviating muscular tension—yet they are traditionally delivered manually, which can be physically taxing for therapists and often results in inconsistent pressure or patterns.</p>
                        
                        <p>We envisioned creating a system where a robotic arm could provide a customizable and repeatable massage experience. This innovation would not only reduce the physical burden on caregivers but also ensure precision and comfort for users. The concept of integrating robotics with human-centric therapy—particularly focusing on hands, which are frequently overlooked in automated massage systems—became our driving motivation.</p>
                        
                        <p>Utilizing the UFactory Lite 6 robot available in our laboratory, we set out to develop a comprehensive solution that combines vision-based detection for accurate hand positioning, B-spline path planning for smooth massage trajectories, and gradient-descent optimization for precise pressure control. Our ultimate goal was to create a unified, user-friendly system that demonstrates the powerful intersection of robotics, computer vision, and intelligent control systems in enhancing therapeutic care and daily wellness practices.</p>
